# Telephones

I'm beginning to feel we've passed telephone peak.

The idea of being able to interrupt someone from what they are doing, at
any time, is a strange concept. With the exception of dire emergencies,
queueing is a much better system.

My first complaint about modern smart-phones is that they are very poor
at making and receiving telephone calls. It might be selective memory,
but I'm convinced that the quality is worse than 10 years ago. The
reliability certainly hasn't improved at the rate of other technologies,
like broadband.

I actually find other benefits of a smart-phone, like internet access,
to be useful, so I don't want to ditch my smartphone entirely - I just
want to ditch the telephone aspect of the device, allowing me to ditch
my provider and go for a relatively less-expensive data SIM option.

I'm considering moving to an async solution, using email in preference
to the phone, and carrying a pager for emergencies.
